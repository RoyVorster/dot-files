# Dot files
Very simple repository for certain configuration files and scripts. Intended for personal use, but feel free to take whatever you like

## For reference
I set this up following a HN thread I read: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754. Read the thread for specific information, essentially it comes down to creating a bare git repository in a folder in your home directory, after which you define the work tree as the home directory itself. No symlinks or extra tools are required.
